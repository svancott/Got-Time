# About me

I'm a developer who's passionate about writing good code and loves the satisfaction of solving problems.

I've developed several apps using JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, and Ruby on Rails, using Git/Github as well as Heroku.

I'm also experienced HTML5 and CSS, and have worked with SQL and Firebase.

Currently, I'm looking for a developer role at a company that's as passionate as I am about doing good work.
